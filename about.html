        <p class="description first">Kings & Queens Worship is a contemporary Christian band with members who have a gift of leading others in worship.
            Starting as a group of friends with a passion for music, we have grown together to pursue helping others enter into
            God's presence. We love writing music and exploring new, trending areas of the worship genre.</p>

            <p class="description second"> We enjoy playing at all
            kinds of events from celebration of life services to acoustic youth worship sets. If you would like us to come lead worship
            at your church or youth event, please contact us. We would love to hear from you!</p>
